" Specially indented symbols
"
" lispwords are indented in the fn style when they:
"
"   * Define vars and anonymous functions
"   * Create new lexical scopes or scopes with altered environments
"   * Create conditional branches from a predicate function or value
"
" The arglists for these functions are generally in the form of [x & body];
" Functions that accept a flat list of forms do not treat the first argument
" specially and hence are not indented specially.
